# Morse_Decoder
Morse code Decoder (using pushbuttons and OLED Screen) with 5wpm speed

I have used two pushbuttons. One pushbutton sends an encrypted Morse Code message to Arduino for decryption; the other pushbutton is used to display the decrypted message(character) through the OLED screen. You have to push the pushbutton for 1sec approx for a "dot" and 2sec for a "dash".

Here is the link of the simulation in wokwi simulator: https://wokwi.com/projects/425214595189811201

You can decrypt any message by each character
